# mini-search-platform

The Mini Search Platform is a news platform specialised in making articles searchable.

The system is inspired by a real-world and proprietary implementation of a Search Platform that runs for the webshop https://momoxfashion.com (company where I work at the time of writing). Some features were removed and others were added based on my wishes for an open-source version of the product.

All functionatilly is exposed to collaborating systems via a unified REST API. Therefore, no user interface is available within this project.

## Functional requirements

The initial version of the system provides search capability to a publishing platform where articles, tags and authors are managed via CRUD operations and made searcheable via the `/search` endpoint.

### Articles

- `POST /articles`
  Create a single article with metadata (title, body, author, tags).
  Automatically syncs the article to the search index.
- `POST /articles/batch`
  Create multiple articles in one request.
  Each article includes an author and a list of tags.
  All articles are synced to the search engine after insert.

### Authors

- `POST /authors`
  Create a new author with a unique ID and name.
- `POST /authors/batch`
  Batch insert multiple authors.
  Useful during initial data ingestion or import operations.

### Tags

- `POST /tags`
  Add a new tag by label.
  If the tag already exists, it can be updated or rejected depending on backend logic.
- `PATCH /tags/:label`
  Update the label of an existing tag.
  Triggers a background resync of related articles in the search index to reflect the updated tag.
- `POST /tags/batch`
  Batch insert multiple tags.
  Returns a summary of how many were inserted vs. failed.
- `GET /tags`
  List all tags stored in the database.
  Supports use in filtering UIs or autocomplete features.
- `GET /tags/:label`
  Retrieve a single tag by its label.
  Useful for checking if a tag exists before assigning it to an article.
- `GET /tags/:label/articles`
  Fetch all articles that are associated with a tag matching the provided label.
  Returns full articles, each with a list of their tags (not just the matching one).

### Search

- `GET /search`
  Perform a full-text search across articles via the search engine.
  Supports keyword queries and may include filters (e.g., by tag or author) depending on implementation.

### Products (TBD)

- Similar to `articles` products should be available as a a possible index type to be made searchable with optimised defaults and pre-defined schema.

### Catalogue (TBD)

- Manage different catalogues based on different marketplaces/languages.
- Enrich catalogue raw data with additional categories and attributes.

### Tenants (TBD)

- Multiple tenants should have its own isolated space to generate API tokens and manage catalogues.

## Non-functional requirements

1. Durability: fault tolerance & archivability of historical data.
2. Agility: strive for streamlined maintenance & isolated testing.
3. Resiliency: service should not stop if dependencies are down or slow to respond (e.g.Cloud Translation API).

## Local setup

### 1. Starting Meilisearch container

docker run -it --rm -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch

### 2. Starting the application

go run cmd/server/main.go

**Note:** the local setup relies on a SQLite database with in-memory driver.

## Sample requests

Sample requests are available at [examples/postman_collection.json](examples/postman_collection.json)

## üóÇÔ∏è Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model)

This system models a publishing platform with articles, authors, and tags. It supports a many-to-many relationship between articles and tags.

## Search Index

The platform allows for dynamic creation of new search indexes matching one of the available types `Article` or `Product`, which will follow a pre-defined schema optimised for each use case.
