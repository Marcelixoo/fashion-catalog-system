# `/decisions`

The `decisions` folder is where all Architectural Decision Records (ADR's) are stored.
These files capture important decisions made as a project develops.

For decisions affecting multiple projects or the whole group, consider creating a separate repository (i.e. `decisions-of-discovery-team`) or a new page on Confluence.
