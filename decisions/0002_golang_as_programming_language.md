# Use Go as our main programming language

## Context and Problem Statement

A programming language has to be chosen for the implementation of each one of the main services. Given that only one engineer will be working on all services, the decision will be one-sided at first and reiterated in the near future for consideration.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Go, because of its simplicity and scalability with a rich set of features for the development of web services. Another major factor for this decision is the team's familiarity with the language, which makes it easier to keep the codebase clean.
